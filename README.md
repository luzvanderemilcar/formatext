# Text Reformatter
-----

This is a tool that is intended to help reformatting text according to the specific rules.
Sometimes, copying text to the clipboard from some apps can break the structure of the text, eg. adding or removing space, line break, etc.

When those text are pasted inside a text-to-speech (TTS) application, the reading becomes difficult to understand.

So, this tool adds so space, and other formats between specific items.
